                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket.
                            We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                            Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                            nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                            e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                            And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                            if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate

                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                         efficient strategy when all KurrentDB clients reside within the kubernetes cluster, but
                         clients outside of the kubernetes cluster will not be able to reach them
                       - "FQDN" (default): clients dial servers by their FQDN, enabling clients outside the
                         kubernetes cluster to reach the server.  If you also have clients connecting from within
                         the kubernetes cluster, this will likely result in hairpin traffic patterns as those
                         clients connect using the external IP address for the KurrentDB nodes, even though both
                         client and server existing inside the Kubernetes cluster.  This hairpin pattern can be
                         avoided by configuring kubernetes-cluster-wide split DNS by adding rewrite rules to your
                         CoreDNS config.

                      InternodeTrafficStrategy defines how KurrentDB nodes will dial each other.  It may be one
                      of three values:
                       - "ServiceName" (default): servers use each other's kubernetes service name to contact each
                         other.  This ensures that internal KurrentDB replication traffic occurs over internal
                         interfaces, but it can cause problems when using public certificates, which cannot
                         validate against kubernetes service names.
                       - "FQDN": KurrentDB servers use each other's FQDN to contact each other.  This can lead to
                         haripin traffic patterns, where traffic from within the kubernetes cluster is directed
                         towards external IPs and then immediately routed back into the kubernetes cluster,
                         potentially decreasing throughput or incurring additional cloud costs.
                       - "SplitDNS": KurrentDB pods dial each other using FQDNs, but each KurrentDB pod is also
                         configured with a sidecar DNS server that intercepts FQDN lookups and returns internal
                         IP addresses.  SplitDNS enables the use of public certificates while avoiding hairpin
                         traffic patterns, with only a negligible resource overhead.

                         Note that SplitDNS only affects DNS lookups originating from pods running KurrentDB.  It
                         will not affect any KurrentDB clients.  If a kubernetes-cluster-wide split DNS
                         configuration is desired, consider adding the rewrite rules to your CoreDNS service.

                                MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.
                                It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                of pods into each bucket.

                                nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                                  skew.
                                A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                                to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                          provisioner.
                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.
                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                      provisioner.
                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.
                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim. If the claim enters an Infeasible error state,
                      this field can be reset to its previous value (including nil) to cancel the modification.
                      If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                      set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                      exists.
